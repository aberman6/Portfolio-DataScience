									<p>Location, location, location! Real estate property value is determined by a variety of factors but location is often touted as one of the most telling. Accessibility to transportation is especially critical in dense urban areas where personal vehicles are less common. But exactly how influential is transportation accessibility in determining a home’s value?</p>
									<p>The following analysis explores the effects of accessibility to transportation on housing prices in New York City using subway, bike share, taxi and Uber. A random forest approach produced the highest accuracy for property price prediction and identified features that are highly influential in predicting price, such as property square footage and age of the apartment, as well as property proximity to subway and bike share stations.</p>

									<!-- Intro -->
									<h2>What does tranportation have to do with housing prices?</h2>
									<p>For the first time in human history, more humans live in cities than in rural areas (Strekas, 2005). This urbanization movement has had dramatic effects on city life, including growth in housing demand and consequently rises in housing prices. The dynamic urban real estate market offers opportunities for buyers and for sellers, but determining the value of a housing unit can be challenging. For sellers, optimizing the sales price on their property ensures that they are able to maximize their Return on Investment (ROI) from their housing unit. For buyers, determining the true value of a housing unit is useful for comparing different properties, as well as for price negotiation later in the process.</p>
									<p>Many features go into a housing unit’s sale value, such as size of the unit, amenities, proximity to landmarks, safety, ambience of neighborhood, etc. Anecdotally, transportation availability is an ever-important factor when evaluating a housing unit, especially in dense urban cities like New York City. But from a quantitative standpoint, exactly how influential are different transportation methods in determining the sales price of a housing unit?</p>
									<p>By integrating features of housing proximity to the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) and bike share stops as well as Taxi Cab and Uber data we’re able to predict NYC housing prices and ultimately better understand the impact of each transportation channel on property value. The results of this analysis have implications for the real estate industry by facilitating accurate pricing of housing units in an extremely competitive market.</p>

                                    <!-- Previous Research -->
									<h2>Previous Research</h2>
									<p>Previous researchers have developed machine learning models to predict housing prices using various neighborhood features, such as crime rate, local business presence, and access to highways (Jingyi Mu et al., 2014). In recent years, as more urban data has become available, researchers have begun to improve these models by integrating additional data sources, such as local census data and education profiles (Gao, 2019). This direction of research shows that as we examine more attributes that affect a housing price, then we can truly start to develop models that mimic the logic of the underlying market.</p>
									<p>In regards to transportation specifically, increased accessibility has been shown to increase housing prices, due to the decrease in commuting costs for both tenants as well as landlords. On the other hand, there are also negative effects of transportation such as noise, traffic, pollution, crime, etc. that can have potentially negative effects on house value (Kilpatrick et Al., 2007).</p>
									<p>Nowadays, there are more options for mobility in cities apart from subway transportation, services such as Uber, Lyft, Citi Bike are changing the way people transport daily. Because New Yorkers can now carpool into Manhattan for just a few dollars, many of residents are rethinking their priorities as homebuyers (Small, 2018). Buyers who do not live close to a subway station, have found alternatives in these services. This industry disruption does not mean that traditional public transportation is being replaced, but instead that a wider, holistic transportation system may begin to affect real estate property value.</p>
									<p>Take bikeshares for example. Once introduced into a metropolitan area, individuals’ transportation options and preferences are subject to change. Among Capital Bikeshare riders, 70% choose bikeshare to get to their destination as the quickest and easiest way. Moreover, bike sharing systems offer benefits such as decreased carbon dioxide emissions, traffic congestion, accident rates  and construction costs (Sobolevsky et Al, 2018). Research has shown that the effects of bikeshare introduction do have an effect on property values. A study published in the journal Transport Policy found an average 2.7% increase property value in central Montreal after the city launched its bike sharing system (El-Geneidy, 2015).</p>
									<p>Recently, researchers have turned to machine learning techniques to analyze urban geospatial data and specifically to examine the effects of transportation in urban areas. One area of research has been focused on using deep learning techniques to model traffic congestion through an Internet of Things based analysis (Ma et al, 2015). Most notably, researchers and engineers at Uber and Lyft use advanced machine learning methods to optimize pickups and dropoffs and provide reliable wait times to users (Turakhia, 2017).</p>

											<p>Taking a look at housing prices in NYC, the highest property prices seem to cluster around lower Manhattan and West Brooklyn with property sales decreasing with distance from this hub. Moreover, subway and bike stations also cluster around this area. Citi Bike System stations in particular are exclusively located in lower Manhattan. This was a challenge in our analysis as distance to the nearest bike station can also be considered a proxy for being in this high priced area.  </p>

									<!-- Methods -->
									<hr class="major" />
									<h2>Methods</h2>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/housing-workflow.png" alt="" /></span>
									
									<h4>Data Preprossing</h4>
									<h5>NYC Property Sales</h5>
									<p>Integral to our research question was how to link transportation information to each property in the NYC Property Sales dataset. The first step in creating this connection was to geolocate each property with latitude and longitude coordinates using Google Maps API as well as manually entering 0.01% of all rows. Through this geolocation, we were able to identify several outliers in terms of location that appears outside of the five NYC boroughs. Due to the urban scope of our research question, we chose to not include properties outside the five boroughs in our analysis.</p>
									<p>The NYC Property Sales dataset included several missing data around property square footage. To account for this missing data, we applied multiple imputation using CART and the mice package to impute square footage in approximately 31% of our data.</p>
									<p>Beyond missing data, this dataset also included several nonsensical values, such as properties with sales prices close to $0. These sales involved deed transfers between parties such as parents transferring property ownership to their children. Again due to the nature of our research question, we chose to drop these records from our dataset and to focus only on traditional property sales. Dropping these observations decreased our data from around 84,000 observations to 56,000. </p>
									<h5>Uber Rides</h5>
									<p>For each property in the NYC Property Sales dataset, we included a feature for number of Uber pick ups on property’s block. Missing pick up and drop off values were imputed using a KNN approach.</p>
									<h5>Taxi Duration</h5>
									<p>For each property in the NYC Property Sales dataset, we were able to not only create features around number of taxi pickups on a given block, but we were also able to include features such as average trip duration, distance, and number of passengers. We also created ‘speed’ features, by dividing trip distance by distance time, which serves as a proxy of traffic accessibility nearby. Missing data was imputed using a KNN approach.</p>
									<h5>NYC Subway</h5>
									<p>For each property in the NYC Property Sales dataset we included a feature with the minimum Manhattan distance to a MTA subway station. Additionally, we also included metrics for the number of subway stations within both five and ten minutes walking distance. </p>
									<h5>Citi Bike System</h5>
									<p>For each property in the NYC Property Sales dataset we included a feature with the minimum Manhattan distance to a Citi bike station. Additionally, we also included aggregate features about the nearest bike station such as the average time bikes are taken and returned to the specific station as well as demographic information about the riders who use the station. </p>

									<h4>Train-Test Split</h4>
									<p>In order to both create as well as evaluate the performance of our model, we separated our original dataset into a training, a validation, and a test set. Out of the 56,000 properties, we split the dataset into 70% training, 20% validation, and 10% testing. We chose to allocate the majority of the data in the training set because each of our approaches required a significant amount of training data to result in accurate validation and test performance. </p>
									
									<h4>Metrics</h4>
									<p>During our model selection process, we attempted several modeling approaches. These initial models included linear regression, KNN, classification and regression tree (CART), random forest, and neural networks. We chose these models based on the ability to predict a continuous outcome.</p>
									<p>For each modeling approach, we used Mean-Squared Error (MSE) as our performance metric, as this is a commonly used evaluation criterion for regression problems. We also evaluated our performance on R-squared or the coefficient of determination. </p>
									
									<!-- Results -->
									<hr class="major" />
									<h2>Results</h2>
									<p>For each modeling approach, we also compared our results to an identical model without the addition of transportation accessibility. In this way, we are able to quantify the value of transportation features in prediction for each approach. Based on the results from our model comparisons, a Random Forest approach produces the most accurate predictions. Random Forest models are especially useful for interpretation because they produce ranked feature importance scores to indicate which variables were most useful in property price predictions.</p>

											<h4>Random Forest Feature Importance</h4>
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/housing-features.png" alt="" /></span>
										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<p>By including transportation data from subways, bike shares, taxis and Uber to our random forest approach, we explain an additional 5% of the variance in housing prices. In terms of specific features, we still see that square footage and year built are the most predictive features in our baseline model. However, we also see that the nearest distance to a bike and subway stations are also important predictors.</p>
										</div>
									</div>

									<p>Our random forest model produced a variety of predictions, some accurate, some inaccurate, and some mediocre.</p>
									<p>The housing sale price in NYC Property Sales dataset have a long tail on both sides; some houses are extremely expensive while others are extremely cheap. There are potentially some other hidden features contributing to the price but fail to be included in our model, such as luxury/poor amenities, great/poor directions or views, etc. Since the transportation features are determined mainly by house location but not house features itself, our model tend to averaging the house price in certain areas, and thus fail to predict the outliers. That would result in overestimation on below average property values and underestimation on above average property values for any given area.</p>

									<!-- Conclusion -->
									<hr class="major" />
									<h2>Conclusion</h2>
									<p>Maybe location isn’t the most important feature in a property after all, at least as it pertains to proximity to transportation options. Even after integration transportation accessibility into our models, the most influential property features were still the square footage of the house and the year the house was built. That said, transportation accessibility does appear to be predictive of housing prices in some capacity. Transportation features such as distance to bike and subway stations were also predictive features of price.</p>
									<p>It should be noted that this does not determine a causal relationship. Often transportation infrastructure is set up in accordance with housing population and demographics. For example, although a properties distance to the nearest bike station was the third most important feature in our model, all bike stations are located in Manhattan and Brooklyn. This finding may only indicate that these areas are popular and desirable, which in this case happens to be the case.</p>
									<p>Future work can hopefully build off of this random forest approach and create new novel methodologies, leading to even more accurate predictions. Ultimately, realtors, investors, sellers, and buyers can all use these models to help with their own real estate estimates.</p>
